matlab miscellaneous image processing tool
====

## bayermask
 provides sampled bayer CFA data and bayer mask

## bayersampling
 samples pixel value associated bayer color filter array

## compLumChrom
 compose luminance (mean) and chrominance to rgb image

 ## decompLumChrom
  decompose rgb image to luminance (mean) and chrominance

## eachchannel
 allows us to apply function for each channel

## imclip
 clips the image intensities

## img2patch
 generates patches from image, each channel patch are concatenated to single column

## imgrad
 calculates horizontal and vertical gradients

## impsnr
 evaluates the psnr and the rmse beween images

## imreadind
 reads image file from file even if the image file is index color, imreadind can read image data as well as rgb image data

## patchdctfilter
 applys dct filter for each columned image patches

## patch2img
 compose image from columned image patches by averaging (almost same to col2im)

## patchtiling
 tiles columned image patches as a image

## rgb2ycc
 transfers color space from rgb to ycc

## rgb123
 translate r, g, and b to 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

## ycc2rgb
 transfers color space from ycc to rgb
